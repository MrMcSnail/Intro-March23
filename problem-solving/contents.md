# Problem Solving

This is a chance to test your problem solving skills. There are some scenarios here designed to emulate real world problems that will require you to translate these situations into code and implement a solution.

Please work on the sections in numerical order.

## Section 1

Please work on `exercises.js` first and `challenges.js` second.

## Section 2

Each of the tasks in this section are prefaced with a number - you should complete them in numerical order.

These challenges are a little tricker than the ones in section 1. Make sure you are applying the principles of problem solving, and you are using pseudo-code to break down your solution into individual logical steps along the way!

## Section 3 - Advanced

Well done if you got this far! Just like in Section 2, please work through the challenges in numerical order.

_Note: There is a lot to get through here we do not expect you to get through them all! As with all of the content we provide we purposely give you more than is doable in the time so you have plenty of extra content to come back to should you wish._
