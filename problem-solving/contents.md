# Problem Solving

This is a chance to test your problem solving skills. There are some scenarios here designed to emulate real world problems that will require you to translate these situations into code and implement a solution.

For each challenge you will need to `cd` into the correct folder and change 'skipTest' to 'runTest' and then run the file in node like this:

```
node part-1.js
```

You will then see the output in the terminal.

## Structure

- First up is the solo-sprint folder, work through the challenges and then onto the advanced challenge if you get that far.

- When you pair up, move on to the paired-sprint folder which again contains some challenges to work through first and an advanced folder if you get to it.

*Note: There is a lot to get through here we do not expect you to get through them all! As with all of the content we provide we purposely give you more than is doable in the time so you have plenty of extra content to come back to should you wish.*
