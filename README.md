# Intro Week Day 3

## How to use this repo

Each topic has its own folder, where the tasks are broken up into sections. Please **read the `contents.md` file** for each topic to understand how to proceed with the tasks.

Please run the files using `node path/to/file.js` and you will then see the output in the terminal. Don't forget to change `skipTest` to `runTest` when you're working on a challenge!
