# Intro Week Day 3

## Morning

This morning you will be working through the problem solving folder.

There is a contents.md file which contains further instructions.

## Afternoon

In the afternoon we will move on to take a look at the array methods folder.

There is a contents.md file which contains further instructions.

## Additional Files
You may notice that there are some additional files in this directory that we have not discussed. You will not need to look into or edit these files but here is a brief summary of their purposes:

- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` contain metadata about this project - you will be enlightened next week as to their true purpose.
- `.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore` contain config information for a specific VSCode extension which helps with code formatting.
- `.gitignore` contains the names of files and directories that we specifically do not want to include in our commits and push to GitHub - the importance of this will be explored next week.
