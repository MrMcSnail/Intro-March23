# Array Methods

These challenges will require you to do some research!

Read each challenge carefully and research the suggested methods to build your solution.

The purpose of this exercise is to practice looking up these new methods and how to use them, even though you may be tempted to use methods you are comfortable with do try and follow this process!

For each challenge you will need to `cd` into the correct folder and change 'skipTest' to 'runTest' and then run the file in node like this:

`node challenges.js`

You will then see the output in the terminal.

As usual we do not expect you to get all of this done! There is a large amount of content here so that you have access to some practice challenges for whenever you want to refer back!
