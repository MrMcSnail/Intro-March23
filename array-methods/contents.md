# Array Methods

- These challenges will require you to do some research!

- Read each challenge carefully and research the suggested methods to build your solution.

- The purpose of this exercise is to practice looking up these new methods and learning how to use them. Even though you may be tempted to use methods you are already comfortable with, do try and follow this process!

For each set of challenges you will need to `cd` into the correct folder, for example:

```
cd array-methods/challenges
```

then run the file in node like this:

```
node part-1.js
```

You will then see the test outputs in the terminal.

`As usual we do not expect you to complete every challenge!` There is a large amount of content here so that you have access to some practice challenges if you ever fancy coming back to them.
