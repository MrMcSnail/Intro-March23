# Array Methods

These tasks will require you to do some research!

Please work on the `exercises.js` file first and the `challenges.js` file second.

## Exercises

Read each question carefully and research the suggested methods to build your solution.

The purpose of this exercise is to practice looking up these new methods and how to use them, even though you may be tempted to use methods you are comfortable with, try and use the new method suggested.

## Challenges

Here are a variety of challenges where there will be good options for array methods, but this time it's up to you to figure out what the best one will be!

Make sure you continue to use the documentation to inform your choices and help your implementation.

_As usual we do not expect you to get all of this done! There is a large amount of content here so that you have access to some practice challenges for whenever you want to refer back!_
